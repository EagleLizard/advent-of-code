My initial solution is working well. I thought the OOP approach would be overkill, but it has been helpful in organizing things in a logical way.

Currently the key sequence is not optimal, but it is correct. When finding each sequence of direction keys to push, there is no "best path" that I can discern - there may be multiple keypress combinations, but they all have equal cost.

This makes me think that the sequence of keys pressed at one level may have varying results at the next level robot.
